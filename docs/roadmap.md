   - SQLite configuration for local development
   - Basic API structure
   - Error handling framework

2. **Data Models**
   - Sri Lankan education system entities
     - O/L results (A-F grades)
     - A/L results (A-F grades + Z-score)
     - University records (GPA)
   - Student profile models
   - Career recommendation models

3. **ML Integration**
   - DJL (Deep Java Library) setup
   - Model preparation in ONNX format
   - Prediction pipeline implementation
   - Model versioning system

## Phase 2: Mobile App Development
1. **Flutter Setup**
   - Project structure
