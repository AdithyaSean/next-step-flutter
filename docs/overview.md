# Next Step - System Overview ðŸŽ“

## System Architecture

Next Step uses a client-server architecture with three main components:

### 1. Central Server (`/next-step-server/`)
Houses both the AI model and database:
- PostgreSQL database for all application data
- LightGBM model for real-time predictions
- RESTful APIs for Flutter client
- WebSocket for real-time updates

Key Technologies:
- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- LightGBM model
- Object Relational Mapping
- WebSocket

### 2. AI Component (`/next-step-ai/`)
Integrated within the central server:
- Monitors database changes for prediction triggers
- Updates predictions in real-time
- Stores results back to PostgreSQL
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Mobile App Component (`/next-step-flutter/`)
Lightweight client application:
- Direct connection to central server
- Real-time data sync via WebSocket
- Material Design 3 UI
- External link handling

## System Features

### 1. Prediction System
- Multi-label career path predictions
- Education level-aware predictions
- Feature engineering pipeline
- Binary career path encoding
- Confidence scoring

### 2. Educational Exploration
- Stream requirements and prospects
- Course details and prerequisites
- Institution links
- Career pathway suggestions

### 3. Career Guidance
- Multiple career path suggestions
- Educational requirements
- Institution websites
- Additional resource links

### 4. Data Management
- Offline-first architecture
- Real-time synchronization
- Data validation
- Link management
