## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure



## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ (for AI model)
- Flutter SDK (for mobile app)
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adithyasean/Next-Step.git
   ```

2. Set up the Flutter App:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Firebase Setup

Here's a step-by-step guide to set up the Firebase Flutter project:

#### Prerequisites
1. Install Flutter SDK
2. Install Firebase CLI:
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
   ```
3. Add firebase to path if not: (for windows)
   ```cmd
   setx PATH "%PATH%;%APPDATA%\npm"
   ```
4. Add flutterfire to path if not: (for windows)
   ```cmd
   setx /M PATH "%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin"
   ```

#### One-time Setup Steps

1. **Login to Firebase:**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

2. **Install FlutterFire CLI:**
   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

3. **Initialize Firebase:**
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```
   ##### choose "Firestore" option
   ##### new project ex:next-step-0004
   ##### accept default locations for rules/indexes 

4. **Configure Firebase:**
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```
   ##### choose your project
   ##### select all platforms
   ##### use default options

5. **Verify Firebase Files:**
   ##### Check android/app/google-services.json exists
   ##### Check ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist exists
   ##### Check lib/firebase_options.dart exists
   ##### Check firebase.json exists

6. **Set Firestore Rules:**
   ```plaintext
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if true;  // Test mode only
       }
     }
   }
   ```

7. **Deploy Rules:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

8. **Verify Setup:**
```dart
// Check in main.dart that Firebase is initialized:
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

#### After Each Pull

1. **Update Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run Build Runner:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

3. **Clean and Run:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter run
   ```

#### Troubleshooting

- If build fails:
  ```bash
  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  flutter run
  ```

#### Important Notes
- Don't commit Firebase configuration files
- Keep `firebase_options.dart` in version control
- Update `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

### Running Components Separately

#### Flutter App
```bash
flutter run  # Run the Flutter app
```
